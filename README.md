# 🌟 Virtual Assistant: CUMI 🌟

----
### `❓ What's it? ❓`

* CUMI, or Central Unit of My Imagination 😂😂, is a Virtual Assistant developed with the C# language. One curiosity is that CUMI was my second programming project made, if I remember, I made it on the second semester of 2018.

* CUMI doesn't use Machine and neither Deep Learning, I developed with the good and old if\else statements even 😂😂.

* The commands are in Portuguese-Brazilian, but I gonna translate it to English-US coming soon.

### `⚒️ Tools ⚒️`

* C#;
* Windows as Operational System;
* Visual Studio (if you wanna alter and compile the code).

----
### `⚙️ Run ⚙️`

> Deploy

* Download the source code and open the *CUMI.exe* on the directory: **CUMI\CUMI\CUMI\bin\Debug**.

> Development

* Download the source code and import the *CUMI folder* into your Visual Studio. Yeah, I know, there are three folders named as CUMI, it's an issue that I'mma solve. About the importation, is the **second CUMI folder** that contains another CUMI folder and CUMI.sln storaged.
